<h1>Concurrent Programming Repository</h1>
<p>Welcome to my repository of C++ code related to concurrent programming!</p>
<p>Here you can find a variety of examples and implementations related to concurrent programming, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Thread synchronization</li>
	<li>Locks and mutexes</li>
	<li>Atomic operations</li>
	<li>Parallel algorithms</li>
	<li>Inter-process communication</li>
	<li>Message passing</li>
</ul>

<p>Since these codes are made as I study and practice, they are subject to many improvements. However, I do my best to make them as understandable and simple as possible. Therefore, I hope that this repository can be a useful resource for anyone interested in concurrent programming in C++.</p>
